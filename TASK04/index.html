    <p><span style="color: rgb(100, 33, 33); font-size: 130%;">Emory Andrew Tate III</span> (born 1 December 1986) is an American and British social media personality, businessman, and former professional kickboxer. He gained notoriety for promoting various positions in the manosphere community.
        His controversial commentary has resulted in his expulsion from various social media platforms and concern that he promotes misogynist views to his audience.<br>
    From 2005, Tate began his kickboxing career in England, winning several kickboxing titles in the late 2000s and early 2010s. In 2016, he appeared on the British reality series Big Brother, but was removed, as he was the suspect in an open rape investigation in the United Kingdom. The investigation was later dropped, but Tate was subject to an extradition request for rape charges in 2024. <br>
    <h1 ><span style="color: blue;">$250 </span>million</h1>
    Andrew Tate is an infamous and polarizing figure, with supporters claiming he’s the icon of “positive masculinity” while critics denounce his “sexist” and “misogynist” views. Like him or not, he is frequently associated with an opulent lifestyle and lavish wealth. Claiming hundreds of millions in net worth, the “Top G” boasts enormous wealth and blames lacking competence for poverty.
